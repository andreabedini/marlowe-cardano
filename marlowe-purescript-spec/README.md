# Marlowe PureScript Spec

This package is a command line tool to help test that the marlowe-cardano PureScript library is compliant with the Blockchain agnostic Marlowe specification.

NOTE: If we split web-common-marlowe into a Web and Language libraries and make them proper libraries, this cli could be part of the Language library.
